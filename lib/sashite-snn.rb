  # Style Name Notation (SNN) implementation for Ruby
  #
  # SNN is a consistent and rule-agnostic format for identifying piece styles
  # in abstract strategy board games. It provides unambiguous identification
  # of piece styles by using standardized naming conventions, enabling clear
  # distinction between different piece traditions, variants, or design
  # approaches within multi-style gaming environments.
