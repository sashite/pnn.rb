  spec.description = <<~DESC
    PNN (Piece Name Notation) provides a rule-agnostic, scalable naming system for identifying
    abstract strategy board game pieces. This gem implements the PNN Specification v1.0.0 with
    a modern Ruby interface featuring immutable piece name objects and functional programming
    principles. PNN uses canonical ASCII names with optional state modifiers (e.g., "KING", "queen",
    "+ROOK", "-pawn") to unambiguously refer to game pieces across variants and traditions.
    Ideal for engines, protocols, and tools that need clear and extensible piece identifiers.
